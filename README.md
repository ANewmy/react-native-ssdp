# SSDP fork for React Native from node

This is a fork of `node-ssdp` that uses `react-native-udp` instead of `dgram` to enable react multicast messaging and plain socket control. The API is the same as in the forked version. Make sure you properly install and link [react-native-udp](https://github.com/tradle/react-native-udp) and set the `Buffer` variable as global or install the browser-compatible npm buffer package.

Make sure you close all the sockets you open and never try to reopen one already open, mobile OSs and React Native are very aggresive both with security and performance, so a misuse could kill your process.

>Â This package powers [Yeti Smart Home](https://getyeti.co) and is used in production. It is maintained with our developers's free time, PRs and issues are more than welcome.

## Installation

```bash
yarn buffer react-native-udp react-native-ssdp
rnmp link # or follow manual linking instructions from react-native-udp
```



## Usage - Client

```javascript
    var Client = require('react-native-ssdp').Client
      , client = new Client();

    client.on('response', function (headers, statusCode, rinfo) {
      console.log('Got a response to an m-search.');
    });

    // search for a service type
    client.search('urn:schemas-upnp-org:service:ContentDirectory:1');

    // Or get a list of all services on the network

    client.search('ssdp:all');
```

## Usage - Server

```javascript
    var Server = require('react-native-ssdp').Server
      , server = new Server()
    ;

    server.addUSN('upnp:rootdevice');
    server.addUSN('urn:schemas-upnp-org:device:MediaServer:1');
    server.addUSN('urn:schemas-upnp-org:service:ContentDirectory:1');
    server.addUSN('urn:schemas-upnp-org:service:ConnectionManager:1');

    server.on('advertise-alive', function (headers) {
      // Expire old devices from your cache.
      // Register advertising device somewhere (as designated in http headers heads)
    });

    server.on('advertise-bye', function (headers) {
      // Remove specified device from cache.
    });

    // start the server
    server.start();

    process.on('exit', function(){
      server.stop() // advertise shutting down and stop listening
    })
```
